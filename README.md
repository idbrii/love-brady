Brady is a camera library for LOVE that features parallax scrolling and aspect ratios.

# Camera Library Comparison

This repo is a demo that uses the camera in the same world as multiple other camera options:

* [brady](https://github.com/idbrii/love-brady/tree/demo-compare)
* [stalkerx](https://github.com/idbrii/love-stalkerx/tree/demo-compare) (no parallax)
* [gamera+parallax](https://github.com/idbrii/love-parallax/tree/demo)

Using the same demo makes it easier to compare the behaviour and features of the camera libraries.
